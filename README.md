***MEME***

- An image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users, often with slight variations.

- An element of a culture or system of behavior passed from one individual to another by imitation or other nongenetic means.

- The word was then abbreviated to just “meme” due to its similarity to the word “gene.” Dawkins coined the term because he was trying to figure out whether there was a measurable unit describing how ideas spread and propagated through generations.
